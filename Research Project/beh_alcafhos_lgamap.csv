"Calculated using age and sex-specific aetiological fractions from the School of Population Health, University of Queensland and AIHW, 2007.  Only NSW residents are included. Figures are based on where a person resides, not where they are treated. Hospital separations were classified using ICD-10-AM. Numbers for the last year include an estimate of the small number of hospitalisations of NSW residents in interstate public hospitals, data for which were unavailable at the time of production. Further details can be found in the Methods tab &nbsp;in the following HealthStats NSW indicator: http://www.healthstats.nsw.gov.au/Indicator/bod_hos_cat Indirect age and sex standardisation was used to calculate standardised rates and ratios; Bayesian smoothing methods were used to calculate the smoothed ratios. Interpretation: '0' result not statistically different than state average, '-' lower than the state average at the 5% level of statistical significance , '--' at the 1% level; '+' greater than the state average at the 5% level of significance, '++' at the 1% level. Local Government Area boundaries used were defined in 2011. .",,,,,,,
